FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course- Certificate project

This project was initially created for getting FCC certificate by completing the project for technical documentation. Then it was improved upon for a little fun to see how can a technical documentation page made to feel & look better. Its not the best, but its made only using basic tech stack for front-end.

Tech Stack used- HTML & CSS only.
